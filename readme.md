Image processing using matlab.

## User's Instructions

In /Lab1_1 contains the Matlab code for basic DFT and DCT.  Just run runDCT.m and runDFT.m to see the result of each.

In /Lab1_2 contains the Matlab code for distinct block DFT and DCT.  Just run runBLK.m to see the result of each and compare the output.

In each folder there is a pika.png to be used as a experiment subject.
